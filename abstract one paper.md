## ONE-PAGE ABSTRACT

**AI Home Safety Guardian: Predictive Risk Monitoring for Seniors**

In Luxembourg, falls are the leading cause of accidental injury among seniors, especially in home settings. Each year, an estimated 6,050 seniors (aged 65 and over) require emergency hospital care for injuries due to falls, with 27% of these cases serious enough to require hospital admission. Tragically, on average 55 people die each year in Luxembourg due to accidental falls, and 82% of these victims are over 65. These incidents often occur during everyday activities like bathing, using the toilet, or getting in and out of bed, leaving elderly individuals living alone particularly vulnerable. This project proposes an AI-powered home safety monitoring system that uses smart sensors to detect and prevent such accidents before they become life-threatening.

The system employs non-intrusive environmental sensors—temperature, motion, gas detection, and electricity monitors—placed throughout the home to monitor daily activity patterns without compromising privacy. The system learns each person's normal routines over 4-6 weeks, then continuously watches for unusual patterns that might indicate a fall, forgotten appliance, or health emergency. When something unusual is detected, the system automatically alerts family members or caregivers within minutes, enabling rapid response even when the elderly person cannot call for help themselves.

The system works through a simple three-step process: sensors in the home continuously collect data about movement, temperature, and appliance usage; this data is securely sent to cloud-based AI systems that analyze patterns and detect when something unusual happens; and when an anomaly is detected, family members and caregivers are immediately notified via email, SMS, or phone call. The system can detect falls, forgotten stoves, or unusual inactivity within minutes, enabling rapid response even when the elderly person cannot call for help.

This solution addresses the critical need for non-intrusive, privacy-preserving care assistance in Luxembourg and the Greater Region, while maintaining elderly autonomy and dignity. The system ensures GDPR compliance by collecting only essential sensor readings (no cameras or microphones), using encryption for all data, and giving users full control over their information. The system is particularly relevant for Luxembourg's rural areas where emergency response times can be 15-20 minutes, compared to 5-7 minutes in urban areas, making early detection crucial for preventing serious injuries or fatalities.

Expected outcomes include a 30-40% reduction in domestic accidents, particularly falls which are the leading cause of injury among Luxembourg's elderly population. The system can improve emergency response times by 10-15 minutes through early detection, potentially preventing serious injuries or fatalities. Estimated healthcare cost savings of €500-800 per household annually could significantly reduce the burden on Luxembourg's healthcare system, which currently treats over 6,000 fall-related injuries among seniors each year.

The project will be deployed in a phased approach: initial sensor installation in 3-5 pilot households in Luxembourg rural areas (Clervaux, Wiltz, Vianden, Echternach, Grevenmacher) for system testing and refinement, followed by expansion to 20-30 households for real-world evaluation. Key challenges include ensuring the system is reliable and doesn't generate too many false alarms, maintaining internet connectivity in rural areas, and balancing safety monitoring with respect for privacy and autonomy. The solution is designed to be fully automated, requiring no interaction from elderly users, making it accessible even to those who are not comfortable with technology.

The solution is particularly relevant for Luxembourg and the Greater Region, where many elderly individuals live in rural areas with limited access to immediate care, and where family members often work across borders in neighboring countries (Belgium, France, Germany). Luxembourg's strong commitment to privacy and data protection makes it an ideal location to develop and test privacy-preserving AI solutions for elderly care. The system can be scaled across the Greater Region, addressing similar challenges faced by aging populations throughout Europe.

This research contributes to the field of elderly care technology by demonstrating how AI can enhance safety without compromising privacy or autonomy. The system provides a practical solution to a real and urgent problem: preventing the thousands of fall-related injuries and deaths that occur each year among Luxembourg's elderly population. By enabling early detection and rapid response, the system can help elderly individuals maintain their independence longer while providing peace of mind to their families. Future work includes expanding deployment across the Greater Region and exploring additional features such as medication reminders and health trend monitoring.

**AI Home Safety Guardian: Predictive Risk Monitoring for Seniors**

In Luxembourg, falls are the leading cause of accidental injury among seniors, with 6,050 seniors requiring emergency hospital care each year and 55 deaths annually from accidental falls. This project proposes an AI-powered home safety monitoring system using smart sensors to detect and prevent such accidents before they become life-threatening.

The system uses sensors placed throughout the home to monitor daily activity patterns, learns each person's normal routines over 4-6 weeks, then alerts family members or caregivers when unusual patterns indicate a potential emergency. The solution is GDPR-compliant, non-intrusive (no cameras), and fully automated. Expected outcomes include 30-40% reduction in accidents, 10-15 minute improvement in response times, and €500-800 annual cost savings per household. A phased pilot deployment in Luxembourg rural areas will evaluate system effectiveness, with scalability potential across the Greater Region.
